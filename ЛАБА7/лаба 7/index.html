                        world, exploring it and independently finding new places and tasks. Skyrim takes place in the
                        fictional province of Skyrim on the mainland of Tamriel on the planet Nirn, two hundred years
                        after the events of the previous game in the series, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. The main
                        storyline of the game is connected with the appearance of the powerful dragon Alduin in Skyrim;
                        the protagonist, Dragonborn, is tasked with stopping the return of the dragons and slaying
                        Alduin.</p>

                        "dragon," and "kiin," meaning "born," or "child" which is typically translated to "Dragonborn,"
                        but
                        it can also be translated to "Dragonchild. Interpreted thus, the name
                        reads "Dragonkind Hunter Born," or "Born Hunter of Dragonkind," an appropriate description of
                        what
                        the Dragonborn is destined to do.
